#### _Now Android users can easily export new contacts to Salesforce CRM as leads. The release coincides with the 10th anniversary of the launch of the company’s first mobile application._

**Milpitas, CA – March 21, 2019 –** ABBYY®, a global leader in Content IQ technologies and solutions, today announced that ABBYY Business Card Reader app for Android can now be integrated with Salesforce to instantly export contacts from scanned business cards to Salesforce CRM as leads. The release coincides with the 10th anniversary of the launch of the company’s first mobile application, Business Card Reader for Symbian. ABBYY will continue to leverage this extensive experience and expertise in mobile to support companies and individuals on their digital transformation journey and deliver frictionless customer and user experience eliminating barriers and boosting productivity.

ABBYY BCR for Android and iOS with the Salesforce integration aims to empower business professionals to connect with customers while freeing them from routine tasks. The app instantly captures contact information from a business card, saves it as a smartphone contact, and exports into the Salesforce CRM system automatically creating a new lead. Mobile workers have new leads appear in the corporate database during or right after meetings – eliminating manual entry.

“Business Card Reader is a perfect companion for sales, legal, insurance, service, and marketing professionals who are always on the go. It saves time, increases productivity, and boosts business results of each employee, department, and the company as a whole, whether it is an SMB or an enterprise. For us, it is especially significant to release this new functionality on the 10th anniversary of our first mobile application. It was a decade of boosting productivity, improving accessibility of information, and bringing digital transformation tools to every mobile device. Today we are looking into the future and reaffirming our commitment to delivering barrier-free customer and user experience and dramatically simplifying business tasks on a mobile device”, comments Bruce Orcutt, Senior Vice President of Product Marketing at ABBYY.

Giving back to its users and customers, ABBYY is happy to announce that anyone can get 1-month Premium subscriptions for FineScanner, TextGrabber, and Business Card Reader for free via the newly launched 10th Anniversary website: [https://10mobile.abbyy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/).

Launched in 2009, ABBYY Business Card Reader for Nokia running on Symbian S60 transformed the way people stored and managed their business contacts. It gave way to today’s Business Card Reader, a cross-platform application for iOS and Android that instantly scans paper business cards, extracts the data, and saves it to smartphone Contacts. The app also allows to easily connect with the new contacts on social media and can be synced with the Apple Watch app and the web client. For simplifying business networking, ABBYY Business Card Reader has been featured by The New York Times, The Telegraph, and CNN.

ABBYY FineScanner has been helping users digitize, edit and share documents on mobile since 2012\. The app for Android and iOS instantly captures documents and books creating digital copies and applies text recognition to convert them into editable formats like PDF, DOCX, and XLSX retaining the original layout. The app has been awarded a PCMag Editors’Choice badge and nominated for a GSMA Global Mobile Award.

Initially launched as five separate apps, ABBYY TextGrabber instantly captures printed text on photo or video and allows to translate it into 100+ languages, edit, share, voice and more. Email addresses, phone numbers, street addresses, and dates become clickable creating a shortcut to the corresponding task: email, call, find on maps or add to Calendar. The app has been featured on TechCrunch, VentureBeat, and Business Insider.
