###### CHALLENGE

Processing different, time-critical documents and invoices for the Rhenus Group’s 80 international sites

###### SOLUTION

Automated capture of all relevant document data using ABBYY FlexiCapture for verification and further processing in the appropriate SAP workflows

###### RESULTS

* Fast implementation
* Transparent monitoring
* Efficient processing of up to 1.8 million documents p.a.

Global transport and logistics service company Rhenus Logistics operates more than 460 sites in more than 40 countries worldwide. Their shared services center (SSC) supports Rhenus’ complex supply chain processes using ABBYY intelligent document processing (IDP) to process up to 1.8 million documents annually from 80 international sites.

 “ABBYY won us over from the very start with an outstanding capture rate and a very good priceperformance ratio. In addition, the expert support made fast implementation possible. Over all, we are extremely satisfied.”

 Thomas Schreiber, Head of Shared Services, Corporate IT, Rhenus Assets & Services

#### Challenge

Up to 1.8 million essential documents are processed each year through Rhenus’ SSC. The majority are time-critical due to the strict deadlines entailed in logistics processes. Documents include purchase invoices, clearing documents, delivery notes, loading records, and order-picking notes. Successful processing requires a high level of control and transparency. One key aspect of this process is ensuring that data is recorded efficiently. To successfully meet these requirements, Rhenus Logistics was looking for:

* Automated capture of all relevant document data
* Efficient, highly accurate verification
* Retention of established processes, including existing automation, in their entirety

#### Solution

ABBYY IDP was selected for its high-quality data extraction, flexible and transparent architecture, scalability, and fast implementation options.

The solution needed to fulfill a wide range of requirements, depending on the type of document, the individual procedures required, and the specific data items. As such, the extraction settings for each scenario were adapted based on test documents in order to make sure they could meet the necessary demands.

Integrated middleware handles archiving and sends status reports to the various logistics systems and/or partners. Now, different departments have direct access to the data and documents they require.
