[ABBYY](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is using its [Digital Intelligence platform](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) to accelerate its public health initiatives. ABBYY solutions digitize and process data within documents used for monitoring public health, including the government agency’s 30-year archive of forms used to report adverse events and current documents to ensure that critical reporting is captured accurately and quickly.

"Going forward, we plan to use ABBYY to process newly received health reports and utilize the data in our downstream enterprise workflow and visualization software,” stated **Justin Scott, Senior Business Informatics Officer, Office of Business Informatics, U.S. FDA**. "ABBYY has brought us into the 21st century."

ABBYY’s Digital Intelligence platform accelerates digital transformation and complements organizations’ existing intelligent automation platforms like RPA, BPM, ERP, ECM, EHR, and others. ABBYY brings together the best NLP, machine learning, and advanced recognition capabilities into a single, enterprise-scale platform to handle every type of document, from simple forms to complex free-form documents whether in electronic, paper and PDF formats. ABBYY enables the FDA to process thousands of pages per day containing over two dozen versions of forms with upwards of 120 complex fields with 99%+ accuracy.

“Government agencies like the FDA realize that automation starts with a comprehensive platform for acquiring, processing, validating and delivering the right data into critical processes,” commented **Bruce Orcutt, SVP of Product Marketing at ABBYY**. "We are helping the FDA capture and extract vital data from complex health documents and ensure they are delivered to the appropriate parties. Having this real-time access to information is the cornerstone to having comprehensive digital intelligence into how their business is operating and fuel more positive outcomes for constituents.”
