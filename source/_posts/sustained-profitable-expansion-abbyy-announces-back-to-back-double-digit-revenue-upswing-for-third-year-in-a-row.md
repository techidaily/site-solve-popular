#### _ABBYY FY19 revenue growth driven by RPA partnerships, expanded product portfolio, and strengthened global presence._

  
ABBYY®, a Digital Intelligence company, today announced its 2019 results, including continued double-digit year-over-year revenue growth and notable growth specific to revenue from RPA integrations and strategic partnerships. Additional drivers of success included an enhanced product portfolio following the acquisition of TimelinePI, now [ABBYY Timeline](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), the only end-to-end Process Intelligence platform. 

ABBYY saw strong revenue growth in regard to its solutions within the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) market in FY19\. Total annual company revenue derived from RPA partnerships, integrations and vendor licensing was up 210%. ABBYY currently has over 50 RPA delivery partners, with [customer adoption rising](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) for several partnerships.

With the new offering, ABBYY’s suite of products enable customers to leverage both Process Intelligence and Content Intelligence to obtain an accurate and complete understanding of how their business processes operate and the content that fuels them. Additional product innovations that contributed to overall company success included enhancements to FlexiCapture, FineReader Server, and new Mobile Capture solutions.

ABBYY continued to see strong demand for its Digital Intelligence solutions in FY19, with customers including one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, smart infrastructure solutions company [Costain](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), a global medical supply manufacturer and distributor [Medline](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsearchenterpriseai.techtarget.com%2Ffeature%2FMedline-streamlines-workflow-by-automating-accounts-payable+%22Medline%22), and other leading enterprises across industries. ABBYY also strengthened strategic partnerships and integrations with the leading global consulting firms. Currently, a third of Fortune 500 companies utilize one or more ABBYY solutions.
