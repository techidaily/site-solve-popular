ABBYY®, a Digital Intelligence company, today announced its 2019 results, including continued double-digit year-over-year revenue growth and notable growth specific to revenue from RPA integrations and strategic partnerships. Additional drivers of success included an enhanced product portfolio following the acquisition of TimelinePI, now [ABBYY Timeline](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), the only end-to-end Process Intelligence platform. 

ABBYY saw strong revenue growth in regard to its solutions within the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) market in FY19\.
