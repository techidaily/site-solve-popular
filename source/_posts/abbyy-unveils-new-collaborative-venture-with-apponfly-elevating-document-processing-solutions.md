_ABBYY FineReader now available to customers via AppOnFly cloud-access service_

ABBYY, an international provider of technologies and solutions to action information, today announced the strategic partnership with [AppOnFLy](https://www.apponfly.com/en/) – an online cloud-access software platform. Now it is making ABBYY FineReader available via online cloud access for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android. Сustomers can use the software on favorable terms of a monthly subscription.

AppOnFly makes ABBYY FineReader OCR and document conversion software accessible online through either the remote desktop protocol (RDS) or directly via browser. ABBYY and AppOnFly partnership is aimed to make ABBYY FineReader more accessible to users on a subscription basis, which has several advantages, such as instant access without downloading, installing or configuration; data sharing, saving and securing; no need to pay for the software when they are not using it.

“We are very excited to deliver our award-winning document conversion software ABBYY FineReader to the AppOnFly customers. FineReader is designed to provide a truly convenient way of digitizing paper documents and working with content — editing and quoting text, copying and reusing data, adapting it for searchable archives,” says Dmitry Golivets, head of sales & marketing department (desktop products) at ABBYY Eastern European HQ. “Now, all these tasks can be performed through the cloud, making the software much more accessible. All AppOnFly customers can now benefit from streamlining their document-driven processes at a fraction of the full price of FineReader by acquiring services on a convenient monthly basis.”

**Availability**

ABBYY FineReader is available on AppOnFly for a monthly fee of €4.90 with a 10-day free trial. Users need to sign up for AppOnFly, then they can access the tool through AppOnFly online store or from the customer dashboard.
