Carlsberg Group, one of the world’s leading brewery groups, was looking for an intelligent solution for its order and delivery processes to accelerate time to market and customer satisfaction. Leveraging ABBYY’s intelligent document processing (IDP) platform, the Carlsberg Group digitally transformed its order and delivery processes.

###### Challenge

Employees had to manually enter information from incoming email orders into their system

###### Solution

ABBYY intelligent document processing technology automatically captures data from incoming orders

###### Results

Touchless order processing rate of 92%; 140+ hours saved per month

 ABBYY has been instrumental to our execution excellence strategy and enabling us to digitally master our data and processes.

 Kamil Kropaczewski, Business Owner at Carlsberg

#### Challenge

Carlsberg receives many orders through email. Previously, employees were checking and entering this order information manually into their system. The delivery registration process for the goods was also highly manual, with files being typed manually into SAP before the goods receipt document was generated and posted.

#### Solution

ABBYY IDP technology was deployed globally in the order process, allowing Carlsberg to automatically capture incoming orders by mail and transfer the data immediately into the company’s SAP system. This significantly reduced manual work.

By integrating ABBYY’s IDP solution in the delivery note scanning process, the whole registration process is now performed automatically. The process of receiving and putting away received goods and reusing vendor labels has significantly accelerated and now enables Carlsberg to have a better overview of the entire delivery process.

#### Value

   * Improved team productivity with 140+ hours saved per month
   * Intelligent automation with a touchless order processing rate of 92%
   * Accelerated customer deliveries, resulting in improved customer satisfaction
