## Special Mobility, Disabling the TextGrabber Signature, and Tracking Your Habits

August 06, 2019

In today’s Mobile Monday, we will look at some innovations that Google developed for people with disabilities. We will also offer some tips on using TextGrabber and tell you about an app that will help you reinforce your good habits.

**Live Relay**

At the recent I/O conference, Google presented a project named Live Relay designed to help people with hearing impairments. Live Relay converts speech to text in real time and can also read out short fragments typed in by the user. The developers are planning to use a similar technology for real-time machine translation allowing speech to be instantly translated into other languages.

In the future, the developers want to use this app as a stepping stone to a real-time translator that will allow audible speech to be instantly translated to a different language, making fluid conversations between people speaking different languages possible.

**Project Euphonia**

[This software](https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/impaired-speech-recognition/), which is still in early research stages, aims to help people with speech impairments communicate more easily. It will use AI to make inaudible and unintelligible speech clearer and easier to understand.

**Project Diva**

[This project seeks to help users interact with Google’s voice Assistant](https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/diva-google-assistant/) through non-verbal communication. This technology is being developed to assist people with diseases like West syndrome and Down syndrome, as well as people with congenital cataracts.

The project team has developed a unique device shaped like a red button that can transmit signals to other devices via a 3.5 mm jack allowing the receiving device to send commands to Google Assistant. Pressing the red button can be interpreted in different ways and the developers have analyzed all sorts of possible presses — from chin and foot taps to bites.

**Voice Access**

[Voice Access](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.voiceaccess&hl=ru) is another accessibility project that lets smartphone users control their device with spoken commands. It can come in handy as a substitute for interface buttons, enabling you to tap, scroll, and make other gestures with your voice.

Currently the app can only recognize commands spoken in English, but the developers are planning to add more languages in the near future.

**Google Maps**

[Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps) Maps now has a feature that allows marking specific locations outfitted for persons with special needs. This information can be updated by the users, making it easier to find locations accessible for persons using wheelchairs.

**Accessibility for Android**

Google has developed a special package of ready-to-use tools that developers can integrate into their own apps to make them more accessible to people with disabilities. The toolkit will enable users to control apps using their voice. It will also read out UI menus and commands, and will cause different buttons to vibrate differently, so that users with visual impairments can easily recognize them.

## **ABBYY Tip: Disabling the “Grabbed with** **TextGrabber** **” Signature Line**

If you are using TextGrabber to send documents via email, then you might have already noticed that sometimes a signature with a text saying “Grabbed with [TextGrabber](https://go.onelink.me/oo1u/cef0166e)” appears at the bottom of your emails. Until recently, this feature was always enabled by default and the text could only be removed from your email manually.

In the latest [TextGrabber](https://go.onelink.me/uny1/c9b5ef5c) updates for iOS and Android, we have added the option to disable this watermark. Follow these steps to remove it on iOS:

1. Open [TextGrabber](https://go.onelink.me/uny1/c9b5ef5c)
2. On the **Notes** screen, tap the cog icon in the top left corner (this will open the settings menu)
3. In the window that opens, locate the **Add signature** option and turn it off

2. On the **Notes** screen, tap the hamburger icon in the top left corner of the **Notes** home page (this will open the menu)
3. In the window that opens, tap **Settings**
4. Locate the “**Add signature**” option and turn it off

For more information about disabling this signature in [FineScanner](https://go.onelink.me/0oMB/2b084a0a), see [this article](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/).

## **App of the Week: Habitty for iOS**

If you are finding it hard to foster healthy habits, then Habitty app is for you. The app helps you to organize and track your regular habits with ease and can also help you set short- and long-term goals.

Unlike most apps in this category, Habitty sports a very minimalistic UI. It won’t ask you to log in in order to set yourself deadlines or compare your track record against that of other users. All you need to do is tick off tasks that you have completed in keeping with your daily, weekly or even haphazard habits.

If you are a gamer at heart, you may like the feature that gives you points each time you act on your habit and penalizes you each time to you fail to do so. With each repetition, a habit becomes “stronger,” while each miss makes it “weaker.” Colorful and detailed built-in charts will help you analyze your progress and see which habits have become your second nature.

Embark on a journey of self-improvement by downloading Habitty for iOS [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1228128916).

That’s all, folks!
