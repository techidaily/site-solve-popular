Processing the referral documents then requires a number of manual steps, which are often interrupted due to missing information or authorizations.

Missed opportunities for patient referral appointments cost hospitals between $821k and $971k per physician per year. Solution ABBYY’s intelligent automation platform for referral management combines intelligent document processing with process mining to automate the integration of patient referral fax data into the EHR and provide guidance to improve the entire referral process end to end.
