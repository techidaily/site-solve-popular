_ABBYY will Present New Version of its Real-Time Recognition Software Development Kit at Booth #A2A_

[ABBYY](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), a global provider of intelligent capture solutions to improve business outcomes, is presenting at the [AI Europe Conference](https://ai-europe.com/) to share its perspectives on how innovative artificial intelligence (AI) solutions can help businesses unlock value in documents. The conference will take place in London the 20th-21st November.

Exhibiting on booth #A2, ABBYY will demonstrate its intelligent capture solutions that deliver process automation to provide better and faster access to business data. Special emphasis will be placed on the machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) capabilities of the solutions.

In addition, ABBYY will demonstrate the new version of its Real-Time Recognition Software Development Kit (RTR SDK) with added data capture functionality. It works by pointing the smartphone camera to display the text on the preview screen, and the data from e.g. IDs, codes on loyalty cards, recharge scratch cards and vouchers, serial numbers on devices, or the IBAN on an invoice is automatically extracted and processed on the device. Enterprises and developers can use the Real-Time Recognition SDK to build apps that enhance customer experiences such as customer onboarding and self-service processes

ABBYY will also be speaking at the event on the following topics:

* Jonathan Darbey, Head of Data Capture at ABBYY, UK, will highlight how the deployment of natural language processing algorithms and text analytics can help organisations unlock, exploit and monetise data sets across the enterprise
* Steve Ponting, Head of Customer Enablement at ABBYY, will present a workshop on how AI and machine learning can enhance data extraction
* Markus Pichler, Director for the Solutions Business Unit at ABBYY, will speak jointly with Boris Krumrey, Chief Robotics Officer at UiPath, a leading Robotic Process Automation platform vendor, on how new intelligent capture solutions and robotics can help process vendor information in fast moving consumer goods

"While a large percent of data is unstructured, innovations in digitisation, analytics, artificial intelligence, and automation are helping organisations to digitise their operations more fully and transform business data into business value,” explained Jupp Stoepetie, Chief Marketing Officer for ABBYY. “Participants at this year's AI Europe will learn about practical, proven use cases of data capture techniques that can help companies improve productivity and accelerate business processes."

The two-day AI Europe Conference (<https://ai-europe.com/>) is where top international strategists, decision makers, influencers, C-levels from every sector of the global market meet to find answers to the main technological and strategic issues raised by artificial intelligence.
