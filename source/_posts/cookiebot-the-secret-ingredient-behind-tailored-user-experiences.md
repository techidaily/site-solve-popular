ABBYY is a Leader in SPARK Matrix: ABBYY is a Leader in SPARK Matrix: Intelligent Document Processing, 2022 Intelligent Document Processing, 2022 Intelligent document processing (IDP) is a technique for automatically extracting useful information from documents received by the organization in a variety of formats, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured documents. IDP uses different technologies such as Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Computer Vision, Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Natural Language Technology (NLT), and Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) to extract, interpret, and classify the relevant data from word ﬁles, emails, PDFs, scanned documents, and other formats for performing analysis and streamlining workflow automation. IDP uses a template-free approach to extract data from documents, especially unstructured documents, with its no-code platform, enabling and strengthening the human-in-the-loop (HITL) capability to extract and unearth hidden information, and rectify the same as per requirement on a real-time basis. The platform is also capable of identifying sensitive data ﬁelds such as the ones with personally identiﬁable information (PII), further making use of data masking to redact or anonymize them. It also supports multiple use cases such as invoices automation, lease & contract processing, customer onboarding, account opening & closing, ﬁnancial reporting, and providing relevant insights and analysis. IDP is thus a crucial component in the digital journeys of organizations, having a transformative and signiﬁcant impact on them. The incoming documents in the organization are usually delivered in a variety of formats due to business logic variations, making it difﬁcult to process all of them with the same accuracy, explaining the substantial prevalence of manual document processes still being followed across the majority of sectors. The incoming document structure could be complicated due to the prevalence of items like tables, graphics, data across several columns, and a mix of semi-structured and unstructured language. Additionally, imprecise object recognition, poorly scanned images, scanning-related problems such as noise and compression, and others further add to the document processing challenges. All these complications further render manual document processing quite cumbersome, thus making the process of data extraction and processing and applying the same to business logic very inconsistent.

The complications and possibility of errors involved with manual extraction processes have led the way to introduce OCR which converts handwritten, typed, scanned text, or text inside images to machine-readable text. However, due to multiple limitations of OCR like recognizing only speciﬁc types of documents, it was infused with artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning giving rise to intelligent document processing (IDP). IDP grew out of OCR and is now serving as the foundation for the next generation of AI-driven process automation to deal with an influx of data more intelligently, by extracting the important information incoming from multiple data points, managing it, and storing it more efﬁciently. IDP can speed up the document extraction process while also increasing operational efﬁciency, which can have several signiﬁcant advantages for businesses and their employees. Additionally, it lessens the possibility of human error and makes the company more compliant. IDP has helped users meet their end-to-end automation goals through key differentiators, including the provision of a uniﬁed low code platform, RPA-infused platform capabilities, zero-shot technology, shadow learning, net promoter system, effective de-duplication capability, digital workers assistance to support industry-speciﬁc use cases, building knowledge graphs, and others. An increase in the adoption of newer technologies is fuelling the growth of document automation, which enables organizations to save time by reducing manual work, operating, and investing more efﬁciently, improving customer experience, and mitigating risks caused by human error. Some of the top automation trends for IDP include document parsing, email parsing, handwriting recognition, hyper-automation, deep integration with AI/ML, touchless/low-touch document processing, and so on. Currently, the smaller vendors within the IDP market have also ingested the majority of the newer technology advancements signaling tough competition across industry players and across verticals. Thus, the current IDP providers are supporting a variety of use cases such as processing invoices, monitoring insurance claims, digitizing medical records, managing accounts payable, and others. The platform providers are investing heavily towards making the platform template-free, providing flexibility to process multiple document types across industries. Additionally, automation of extraction tasks in regard to enhanced compatibility for dealing with a variety of handwritten documents and documents in multiple languages, are some of the other signiﬁcant use cases attracting end-users.

This would ensure that the IDP solution could be integrated smoothly with automation technologies like RPA, BPM, and business applications like CRM, ERP, HRMS, ECM, and others, based on end-user requirements. Furthermore, large enterprise customers wish to leverage their in-house development efforts enabling a ‘Bring Your Own Model (BYOM)’ by making use of in-house data science and scripting capabilities in combination with third-party platforms. This ensures the creation of a competitive advantage from their proprietary business knowledge, minus the need to invest in huge resources for building relevant platforms. Other critical enablers include the flexibility of pay-as-you-go Enterprise SaaS offerings which provides a distinct advantage to organizations by eliminating the pricy infrastructure challenges, resulting in signiﬁcant cost savings. Also, the provision of an ensemble of models with machine learning capabilities and assisted operations used for - making accurate predictions, data extraction, and document segregation are crucial for enhancing the organizational digital journeys. Additionally, the vendors are also planning to further enhance their proprietary IDP platform by gathering relevant training data sets, offering automated and continuous AI learning models, identifying and labeling features, and conducting exhaustive dry runs for testing and bettering the algorithm. Ultimately, vendors are now moving towards providing knowledge graph technologies to understand documents, the same way a human subject matter expert would. This would enable users to make effective use of the data model to integrate interlinked entities, including objects, events, processes, or abstract concepts as well. The document process owners could further achieve a touchless document processing experience, agnostic of the inbound document type. Lastly, the human-in-the-loop capability would greatly enable the IDP platform to learn and improve on the relevant data extraction rules continuously based on human inputs, and then undertake automatic corrections over time.

The platform also promotes an integrated set of IDP technology services by incorporating OCR, ML, and NLP, thus allowing training for ﬁeld and entity extraction and classiﬁcation of documents, further cementing its unique value proposition. • In terms of geographical spread, ABBYY has a commanding presence in North America, especially in the USA, followed by Europe and Knowledge Brief

The company also has a signiﬁcant presence in the Middle East, and Africa, followed by Latin America. ABBYY holds a strong customer base, including some of the leading brands across industry verticals such as banking & ﬁnancial services, government & public sector, transportation and logistics, life sciences & healthcare, manufacturing, IT & telecom, and others. • Some of the top use cases of ABBYY’s IDP application include processing and data extraction from bank statements, mortgage applications, loan origination, KYC, AP invoices, sales orders, purchase orders, government forms, certiﬁcates of origin, bills of lading, proof of delivery, insurance claims, underwriting documents, claims-related documents, and tax forms. • As per Quadrant’s estimation, ABBYY faces signiﬁcant competition from emerging vendors offering innovative and competitive solutions. Being an established provider of business automation solutions, the company may also face competition from vendors offering standalone IDP solutions. However, the company gives tough competition to most of the players with its robust OCR and RPA capabilities, high scalability performance, strong partnership ecosystem, and a broad range of industry coverage. With its sophisticated technology platform and comprehensive functional capabilities, ABBYY is well-positioned to expand its share in the global IDP market in the near future. • In terms of future roadmap, ABBYY will focus on strengthening its cloud-ﬁrst Vantage platform that can deliver IDP capabilities as a uniﬁed set of services from OCR to NLP integrated with AI and ML. The company will also focus on delivering consistent ‘consumerized’ UX/UI standard services – a novel way of conﬁguring, training, and consuming IDP services across automation platforms, including within RPA, BPM, and other automation tools. Additionally, ABBYY is actively investing in features like data capture and extraction from mobile web browser tools wherein users won’t be required to install a mobile application for use cases, including but not limited to customer onboarding.
