ABBYY®, a global provider of content intelligent solutions and services, will join the world’s foremost innovators at The AI Summit London on 13th and 14th June. ABBYY, a Platinum Sponsor of the conference, will showcase its expertise in Artificial Intelligence (AI), innovations in AI-powered content intelligence and digital transformation alongside Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Accenture and IBM, to help participants gain a practical understanding of AI, its use cases and impact on content-centric business processes

During the keynote at 2:25pm on the 14th June, ABBYY Chief Innovation Officer Anthony Macciola will address the challenge of getting valuable insights from unstructured content to gain a competitive edge. He will discuss trends in Robotic Process Automation and talk about how content intelligence can make robots smarter. “AI improves the way enterprises and organisations understand their customers, their desires, and goals. Content Intelligence enables real-time understanding of content and communications, providing faster, more convenient customer service and efficient processing of information. Resolving customer service issues before they arise could significantly lower customer abandonment rates,” commented Anthony Macciola, Chief Innovation Officer at ABBYY Global.

During the conference, ABBYY will be revealing the results of an independent survey of 1,200 UK employees to find our which tasks workers would be happy to outsource to robots.

At the booth 440, hall 13, ABBYY will also demonstrate FlexiCapture and Text Analytics for Contracts – two Natural Language Processing-based technologies that implement AI to help thousands of companies around the world to improve business processes.

The AI Summit London will take place in ExCel Exhibition Centre and will be part of London Tech Week. During the Summit, leading C-suite executives will share insights and best practice for incorporating AI into their business across a number of different industries and business functions to create unprecedented efficiencies in human productivity.
