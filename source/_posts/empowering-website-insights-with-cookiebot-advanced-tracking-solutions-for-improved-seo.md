#### _New ‘point and capture’ toolkit empowers instant use of text-based information viewed through smartphones and tablets_

ABBYY Europe, a leading provider of technologies and solutions to action information, today introduced its new Real-Time Recognition technology, enabling ‘instant’ text extraction from the preview screen of mobile devices. Real-Time Recognition based on ABBYY technology enables faster, simpler extraction of text from documents and objects placed in the live video stream from smartphone and mobile device’ cameras. Data extracted using Real-Time Recognition can be used in a variety of mobile applications ranging from highly responsive customer services to automated enterprise processes and consumer apps.

Applications based on the ABBYY Real-Time Recognition SDK (software development kit) can pull text from on-screen objects and automatically convert it into digital data. The conversion takes place directly on the mobile device and within the mobile application. The technology adds a new level of convenience to mobile apps by replacing tedious manual data entry. Once digitised, data can be easily processed by the application or even sent to cloud-based systems for further handling. On-screen images are processed in real-time, eliminating the need to take a photo and save it in order to process the data and then access the information. This makes the data entry process simpler and more intuitive for app users.

To meet the increasing demand for more responsive, ‘anywhere, anytime’ services in today’s fast-paced digital environment, enterprises can develop real-time recognition-enabled customer services and products to speed up data acquisition and processing times. As part of customer onboarding processes, such as opening an account or loan application, information from ID cards, salary payslips and other documents can be captured within seconds and then transferred directly into online forms or apps for new customer sign-ups. For customer self-services provided by banks or insurance companies, mobile apps can quickly extract and use transactional information such as bank transfer details (IBAN, etc.) or policy numbers in claim forms, to make data entry processes more efficient. As no photos are stored on the device, the technology is well-suited for use in processes that must comply with data security and data privacy standards.

Software vendors developing consumer apps can easily add new functionality and value for their users. For example, travel apps can offer fast translation assistance when images captured on preview screens can be quickly translated using mobile dictionaries. Text reading apps for those with reading and learning disabilities can be enhanced by ‘live text input’ into their text-to-speech components.

“Real-Time Recognition can help transform data into outstanding customer experiences,” explains Dr. Rainer Pausch, product group head, SDK products at ABBYY Europe. “Simply point your device’s camera at text and ‘lift out’ what you can see live on the display. This provides an extremely intuitive and accurate way to capture information printed on virtually any background. This means it’s ready for instant use, on-device response and no more typing. We see great value with this new ABBYY technology and strongly believe that it can be a real value-add to a vast range of mobile apps”.

The new Real-Time Recognition SDK complements ABBYY’s comprehensive portfolio of tools that simplify capture, digitisation, and extraction of data. ABBYY’s offering ranges from mobile-based information capture and OCR processing, to enterprise-level automated document processing and data extraction. 

#### Specifications and Availability

ABBYY Real-Time Recognition SDK is available for integration into new or existing applications for iOS and Android. The ABBYY developer toolkit supports easy integration and offers code samples and ‘quick start’ guides to help developers get started. The SDK supports capture of texts in 63 languages.
