**_For the first time, Toshiba Tec MFPs with ABBYY FineReader Engine for Embedded OS feature advanced capabilities such as PDF conversion, language translation and digitization of information for easy searches_**

ABBYY®, a leading provider of technologies and solutions to action information, today announced that its [FineReader Engine](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) is at the core of the new series of multi-function printers (MFPs) from Toshiba Tec Corporation (TOKYO: 6588), available in early summer 2016.

For the first time, people can easily scan and open images, PDFs and scanned documents, in multiple languages, simply by using Toshiba’s newest [e-STUDIO™ MFPs](http://www.toshibatec.com/information/20160517%5F01.html) embedded with ABBYY’s powerful OCR software development kit (SDK). ABBYY’s SDK uses intelligent algorithms to convert scanned documents and images into editable, searchable text, while also preserving the original layout and formatting of the initial document. ABBYY’s FineReader Engine delivers award-winning OCR plus barcode recognition (OBR), document imaging and PDF conversion to the five new Toshiba MFPs.

“Our new series of Toshiba MFPs are customizable to best meet the evolving needs of how people and organizations create, record, share, manage and display ideas and data,” said Yasu Jingu, senior manager, product planning department at Toshiba Tec Corporation. “We looked at multiple technologies for integrating into our newest MFPs, but ultimately selected ABBYY because its technology delivers industry-leading accuracy and superior performance.”

As announced this month, Toshiba Tec’s latest series is built on the e-BRIDGE™ Next, which is an enhanced user interface, embedded application platform, along with advanced cloud and mobile printing capabilities. The new touchscreen user interface allows for easy customization to address users’ preferences and needs, and to adapt to organizations’ workflows.

“We share the vision with our long-time partner, Toshiba, of engineering and executing on technologies that help organizations around the world to digitize and automate their document-centric processes,” said Joe Budelli, Senior Vice President, Global Licensing, ABBYY NAHQ. “These new MFPs with ABBYY’s OCR built in are the latest innovations to improve productivity and information accuracy.”
