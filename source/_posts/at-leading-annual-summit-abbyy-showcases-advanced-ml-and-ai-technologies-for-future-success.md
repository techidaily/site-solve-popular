ABBYY®, a leading provider of technologies and solutions to action information, is hosting its fifth annual ABBYY Technology Summit (#ABBYYSummit17) October 25 – 27, 2017 at the Marriott Marquis San Diego Marina. Attendees at the summit will gain better understanding of strategies and tools to accelerate digital transformation initiatives that leverage their data to drive measurable business value.

ABBYY Technology Summit keynote speakers include Mike Gough, Advisory Manager at KPMG, who will inspire attendees with, “Capitalizing on Robotics, Driving Savings with Digital Labor,” and Martyn Christian, Founder of UNDRSTND Group, who will motivate attendees with an understanding of, “The Evolution and Ultimate Collision of Capture, Content, Context and Analytics: How Did We End Up Here and Where are We going?” The technology summit agenda is packed with interactive technology sessions and best practices from a variety of global organizations, including UiPath, a leader in robotic process automation.

“Corporate leaders have become inundated with data required to process customer, employee, and partner requests and are under pressure to not only maintain pace with this information, but to also be proactive with it,” stated Ulf Persson, CEO at ABBYY. “The ABBYY Technology Summit is where business leaders can learn from peers on how they’ve transformed their processes with the latest technologies including machine learning, artificial intelligence, intelligent capture, natural language processing and text analytics. Organizations need a firm foundation of capturing and analyzing data in order to be successful with their digital transformation initiatives.”
