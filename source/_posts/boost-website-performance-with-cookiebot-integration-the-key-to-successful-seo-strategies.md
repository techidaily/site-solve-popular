[Pipefy](https://www.pipefy.com/), the low-code process automation platform, today announced a partnership with ABBYY, the industry leader in Intelligent Document Processing (IDP), to offer a powerful integrated solution that accelerates digital transformation initiatives ideal for use in people operations, financial services and insurance.

The integrated solution fuses Pipefy’s [process automation capabilities with ABBYY’s](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Together, these two technologies take workflow and process optimization to a new level, by empowering non-technical users to build more efficient workflows while integrating cloud-based digital documents through data extracted by ABBYY’s artificial intelligence.

By deploying an IDP technology like ABBYY in tandem with Pipefy’s process automation platform, companies achieve dramatic gains in productivity and are able to make faster business decisions. The partnership offers increased speed and accuracy by turning process-related documents into data with a solution that reads, analyzes and processes the content like humans. This way, the joint solution improves processes with extensive document-driven manual work:

* **People Operations:** According to a Gallup survey, 58% of organizations use onboarding resources for paper-intensive tasks. ABBYY provides pre-trained document skills that automate both the capturing and the analysis of HR onboarding documents. Pipefy automates all new hire communications and manual tasks to improve cross-team collaboration and data centralization, reducing new employee hiring time by 80%.
* **Financial Service Operations:** Finance teams get the perfect tools to automate document intake processes and streamline regulatory compliance. They can accelerate loan lifecycles by reducing complexity, enabling faster funding, and improving trade service quality levels (avoiding fraud and fines).
* **Insurance:** The integration between ABBYY and Pipefy means faster, more accurate underwriting, quoting, customer onboarding, and endorsement processing. It enables increased new business and renewal retention. On the claims side, it can also ease the First Notice of Loss, repair estimate reviews, and settlement invoices processing.

"ABBYY simplifies how companies process their documents in a low-code/no-code environment.   
As a result, companies can automate manual processes, work in modern architecture, and achieve faster time to implementation – all resulting in better outcomes for customers and the business."

_Bruce Orcutt, SVP of Product Marketing at ABBYY_

"Pipefy and ABBYY combine low-code process automation with efficient document processing."

_Wanessa Siewert, Pipefy’s Program and Alliances Manager_

"The joint solution is critical to accelerate digital transformation in departments where a paperwork-prone culture would place obstacles to process excellence and efficiency."

_Gustavo de Martini, Pipefy’s Vice President of Partners_
